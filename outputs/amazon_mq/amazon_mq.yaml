            personally identifiable information \(PII\) or other confidential or
            sensitive information in broker names\. Broker names are accessible

        PubliclyAccessible:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Enables connections from applications outside of the VPC that hosts
            the broker's subnets\.
        SecurityGroups:
          type: array
          description: >-
            The list of rules \(1 minimum, 125 maximum\) that authorize

          description: The broker's storage type\.
        SubnetIds:
          type: array
          description: >-
            The list of groups that define which subnets and IP ranges the
            broker can use from different Availability Zones\. If you specify
            more than one subnet, the subnets must be in different Availability
            Zones\. Amazon MQ will not be able to create VPC endpoints for your
            broker with multiple subnets in the same Availability Zone\. A
            SINGLE\_INSTANCE deployment requires one subnet \(for example, the
            default subnet\)\. An ACTIVE\_STANDBY\_MULTI\_AZ deployment
            \(ACTIVEMQ\) requires two subnets\. A CLUSTER\_MULTI\_AZ deployment
            \(RABBITMQ\) has no subnet requirements when deployed with public
            accessibility, deployment without public accessibility requires at
            least one subnet\.    If you specify subnets in a shared VPC for a
            RabbitMQ broker, the associated VPC to which the specified subnets
            belong must be owned by your AWS account\. Amazon MQ will not be
            able to create VPC enpoints in VPCs that are not owned by your AWS
            account\.

            first provisioned\. All subsequent RabbitMQ users are created by via
            the RabbitMQ web console or by using the RabbitMQ management API\.
