            The personal access token for a GitHub repository for an Amplify
            app\. The personal access token is used to authorize access to a
            GitHub repository using the Amplify GitHub App\. The token is not
            stored\.   Use `AccessToken` for GitHub repositories only\. To
            authorize access to a repository provider such as Bitbucket or
            CodeCommit, use `OauthToken`\.   You must specify either
            `AccessToken` or `OauthToken` when you create a new app\.   Existing
            Amplify apps deployed from a GitHub repository using OAuth continue
            to work with CI/CD\. However, we strongly recommend that you migrate
            these apps to use the GitHub App\. For more information, see

          description: >-
            Specifies whether Amplify Hosting creates a preview for each pull
            request that is made for this branch\. If this property is enabled,
            Amplify deploys your app to a unique preview URL after each pull
            request is opened\. Development and QA teams can use this preview to
            test the pull request before it's merged into a production or
            integration branch\.   To provide backend support for your preview,
            Amplify automatically provisions a temporary backend environment
            that it deletes when the pull request is closed\. If you want to
            specify a dedicated backend environment for your previews, use the
            `PullRequestEnvironmentName` property\.   For more information, see
            [Web

            If pull request previews are enabled for this branch, you can use
            this property to specify a dedicated backend environment for your
            previews\. For example, you could specify an environment named
            `prod`, `test`, or `dev` that you initialized with the Amplify CLI
            and mapped to this branch\.   To enable pull request previews, set
            the `EnablePullRequestPreview` property to `true`\.   If you don't
            specify an environment, Amplify Hosting provides backend support for
            each preview by automatically provisioning a temporary backend
            environment\. Amplify Hosting deletes this environment when the pull
            request is closed\.   For more information about creating backend
            environments, see [Feature Branch Deployments and Team
