    ObservabilityConfiguration:
      type: object
      properties:
        ObservabilityConfigurationName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A name for the observability configuration\. When you use it for the
            first time in an AWS Region, App Runner creates revision number `1`
            of this name\. When you use the same name in subsequent calls, App
            Runner creates incremental revisions of the configuration\.   The
            name `DefaultConfiguration` is reserved\. You can't use it to create
            a new observability configuration, and you can't create a revision
            of it\.   When you want to use your own observability configuration
            for your App Runner service, *create a configuration with a
            different name*, and then provide it when you create or update your
            service\. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates
            a name for your observability configuration\.

          description: >-
            The configuration of the tracing feature within this observability
            configuration\. If you don't specify it, App Runner doesn't enable
            tracing\.

        AutoScalingConfigurationArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of an App Runner automatic scaling
            configuration resource that you want to associate with your
            service\. If not provided, App Runner associates the latest revision
            of a default auto scaling configuration\.   Specify an ARN with a
            name and a revision number to associate that revision\. For example:
            `arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability/3`   
            Specify just the name to associate the latest revision\. For
            example:
            `arn:aws:apprunner:us-east-1:123456789012:autoscalingconfiguration/high-availability`

            An optional custom encryption key that App Runner uses to encrypt
            the copy of your source repository that it maintains and your
            service logs\. By default, App Runner uses an AWS managed key\.

            running App Runner services in your AWS account in the AWS
            Region\.   If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates
            a name for your service\.

          description: >-
            A list of IDs of security groups that App Runner should use for
            access to AWS resources under the specified subnets\. If not
            specified, App Runner uses the default security group of the Amazon
            VPC\. The default security group allows all outbound traffic\.
        Subnets:
          type: array
          description: >-
            A list of IDs of subnets that App Runner should use when it
            associates your service with a custom Amazon VPC\. Specify IDs of
            subnets of a single Amazon VPC\. App Runner determines the Amazon
            VPC from the subnets you specify\.    App Runner currently only
            provides support for IPv4\.
