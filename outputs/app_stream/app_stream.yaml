            The fleet type\.     ALWAYS\_ON   Provides users with instant\-on
            access to their apps\. You are charged for all running instances in
            your fleet, even if no users are streaming apps\.   ON\_DEMAND  
            Provide users with access to applications after they connect, which
            takes one to two minutes\. You are charged for instance streaming
            when users are connected and a small hourly fee for instances that
            are not streaming apps\.   ELASTIC   The pool of streaming instances
            is managed by Amazon AppStream 2\.0\. When a user selects their
            application or desktop to launch, they will start streaming after
            the app block has been downloaded and mounted to a streaming
            instance\.
        IamRoleArn:

          description: >-
            The ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the fleet\. To assume a

            `AssumeRole` API operation and passes the ARN of the role to use\.
            The operation creates a new session with temporary credentials\.
            AppStream 2\.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the
            **appstream\_machine\_role** credential profile on the instance\.  
            For more information, see [Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to
            Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2\.0 Streaming
            Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appstream2/latest/developerguide/using-iam-roles-to-grant-permissions-to-applications-scripts-streaming-instances.html)

        IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The amount of time that users can be idle \(inactive\) before they
            are disconnected from their streaming session and the
            `DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds` time interval begins\. Users are
            notified before they are disconnected due to inactivity\. If they
            try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval
            specified in `DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds` elapses, they are
            connected to their previous session\. Users are considered idle when
            they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming
            session\. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and
            pixels changing do not qualify as user activity\. If users continue
            to be idle after the time interval in
            `IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds` elapses, they are disconnected\.  
            To prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify
            a value of 0\. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600\.   If
            you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that
            corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes \(for example, 60,
            120, and 180\)\. If you don't do this, the value is rounded to the
            nearest minute\. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users
            are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity\. If you specify a
            value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the
            value is rounded up\. For example, if you specify a value of 90,
            users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity\.
