            The overall status of the assessment\.   When you create a new
            assessment, the initial `Status` value is always `ACTIVE`\. When you
            create an assessment, even if you specify the value as `INACTIVE`,
            the value overrides to `ACTIVE`\.    After you create an assessment,
            you can change the value of the `Status` property at any time\. For
            example, when you want to stop collecting evidence for your
            assessment, you can change the assessment status to `INACTIVE`\.
