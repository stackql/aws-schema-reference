            The name of a logical container where backups are stored\. Backup

            If you specify a key, you must specify its ARN, not its alias\. If
            you do not specify a key, AWS Backup creates a KMS key for you by
            default\.   To learn which AWS Backup services support full AWS
            Backup management and how AWS Backup handles encryption for backups
            from services that do not yet support full AWS Backup, see [
