            The advanced event selectors to use to select the events for the
            data store\. You can configure up to five advanced event selectors
            for each event data store\.    For more information about how to use
            advanced event selectors to log CloudTrail events, see [Log events
            by using advanced event
            selectors](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html#creating-data-event-selectors-advanced)

        KmsKeyId:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use to encrypt the events delivered
            by CloudTrail\. The value can be an alias name prefixed by `alias/`,
            a fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key,
            or a globally unique identifier\.   Disabling or deleting the KMS
            key, or removing CloudTrail permissions on the key, prevents
            CloudTrail from logging events to the event data store, and prevents
            users from querying the data in the event data store that was
            encrypted with the key\. After you associate an event data store
            with a KMS key, the KMS key cannot be removed or changed\. Before
            you disable or delete a KMS key that you are using with an event
            data store, delete or back up your event data store\. CloudTrail
            also supports AWS KMS multi\-Region keys\. For more information
            about multi\-Region keys, see [Using multi\-Region
            keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)

        MultiRegionEnabled:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether the event data store includes events from all
            regions, or only from the region in which the event data store is
            created\.

        TerminationProtectionEnabled:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether termination protection is enabled for the event
            data store\. If termination protection is enabled, you cannot delete
            the event data store until termination protection is disabled\.
    ResourcePolicy:

      properties:
        ResourceArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the CloudTrail channel attached
            to the resource\-based policy\. The following is the format of a
            resource ARN:

        ResourcePolicy:
          type: object
          description: >-
            A JSON\-formatted string for an AWS resource\-based policy\.    The
            following are requirements for the resource policy:   +  Contains
            only one action: cloudtrail\-data:PutAuditEvents  +  Contains at
            least one statement\. The policy can have a maximum of 20
            statements\.  +  Each statement contains at least one principal\. A
            statement can have a maximum of 50 principals\.

      type: object
      properties:
        CloudWatchLogsLogGroupArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\), a
            unique identifier that represents the log group to which CloudTrail
            logs are delivered\. You must use a log group that exists in your
            account\.   Not required unless you specify
            `CloudWatchLogsRoleArn`\.
        CloudWatchLogsRoleArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to
            write to a user's log group\. You must use a role that exists in
            your account\.
        EnableLogFileValidation:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether log file validation is enabled\. The default is
            false\.   When you disable log file integrity validation, the chain
            of digest files is broken after one hour\. CloudTrail does not
            create digest files for log files that were delivered during a
            period in which log file integrity validation was disabled\. For
            example, if you enable log file integrity validation at noon on
            January 1, disable it at noon on January 2, and re\-enable it at
            noon on January 10, digest files will not be created for the log
            files delivered from noon on January 2 to noon on January 10\. The
            same applies whenever you stop CloudTrail logging or delete a
            trail\.
        EventSelectors:
          type: >-
            list of
            [eventselector](aws-properties-cloudtrail-trail-eventselector.md)
          description: >-
            Use event selectors to further specify the management and data event
            settings for your trail\. By default, trails created without
            specific event selectors will be configured to log all read and
            write management events, and no data events\. When an event occurs
            in your account, CloudTrail evaluates the event selector for all
            trails\. For each trail, if the event matches any event selector,
            the trail processes and logs the event\. If the event doesn't match
            any event selector, the trail doesn't log the event\.   You can
            configure up to five event selectors for a trail\.
        IncludeGlobalServiceEvents:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global
            services such as IAM to the log files\.
        InsightSelectors:
          type: >-
            list of
            [insightselector](aws-properties-cloudtrail-trail-insightselector.md)
          description: >-
            A JSON string that contains the insight types you want to log on a
            trail\. `ApiCallRateInsight` and `ApiErrorRateInsight` are valid
            insight types\.
        IsLogging:
          type: boolean
          description: Whether the CloudTrail trail is currently logging AWS API calls\.
        IsMultiRegionTrail:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether the trail applies only to the current region or to
            all regions\. The default is false\. If the trail exists only in the
            current region and this value is set to true, shadow trails
            \(replications of the trail\) will be created in the other regions\.
            If the trail exists in all regions and this value is set to false,
            the trail will remain in the region where it was created, and its
            shadow trails in other regions will be deleted\. As a best practice,
            consider using trails that log events in all regions\.
        IsOrganizationTrail:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether the trail is applied to all accounts in an
            organization in AWS Organizations, or only for the current AWS
            account\. The default is false, and cannot be true unless the call
            is made on behalf of an AWS account that is the management account
            or delegated administrator account for an organization in AWS
            Organizations\. If the trail is not an organization trail and this
            is set to `true`, the trail will be created in all AWS accounts that
            belong to the organization\. If the trail is an organization trail
            and this is set to `false`, the trail will remain in the current AWS
            account but be deleted from all member accounts in the
            organization\.
        KMSKeyId:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the AWS KMS key ID to use to encrypt the logs delivered by
            CloudTrail\. The value can be an alias name prefixed by "alias/", a
            fully specified ARN to an alias, a fully specified ARN to a key, or
            a globally unique identifier\.   CloudTrail also supports AWS KMS
            multi\-Region keys\. For more information about multi\-Region keys,
            see [Using multi\-Region
            keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html)

        S3BucketName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the name of the Amazon S3 bucket designated for publishing
            log files\. See [Amazon S3 Bucket Naming
            Requirements](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/create_trail_naming_policy.html)\.
        S3KeyPrefix:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the Amazon S3 key prefix that comes after the name of the
            bucket you have designated for log file delivery\. For more
            information, see [Finding Your CloudTrail Log
            Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-find-log-files.html)\.
