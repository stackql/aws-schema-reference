          description: >-
            Information about code to be committed to a repository after it is
            created in an AWS CloudFormation stack\. Information about code is
            only used in resource creation\. Updates to a stack will not reflect
            changes made to code properties after initial resource creation\.   
            You can only use this property to add code when creating a
            repository with a AWS CloudFormation template at creation time\.
            This property cannot be used for updating code to an existing
            repository\.
        RepositoryDescription:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A comment or description about the new repository\.   The
            description field for a repository accepts all HTML characters and
            all valid Unicode characters\. Applications that do not HTML\-encode
            the description and display it in a webpage can expose users to
            potentially malicious code\. Make sure that you HTML\-encode the
            description field in any application that uses this API to display
            the repository description on a webpage\.
        RepositoryName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the new repository to be created\.   The repository name
            must be unique across the calling AWS account\. Repository names are
            limited to 100 alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters, and
            cannot include certain characters\. For more information about the
            limits on repository names, see
            [Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/limits.html)
            in the * AWS CodeCommit User Guide*\. The suffix \.git is
            prohibited\.
