      type: object
      properties:
        ActivationKey:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Your agent activation key\. You can get the activation key either by
            sending an HTTP GET request with redirects that enable you to get
            the agent IP address \(port 80\)\. Alternatively, you can get it
            from the DataSync console\.   The redirect URL returned in the
            response provides you the activation key for your agent in the query
            string parameter `activationKey`\. It might also include other
            activation\-related parameters; however, these are merely defaults\.
            The arguments you pass to this API call determine the actual
            configuration of your agent\.   For more information, see [Creating
            and activating an
            agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/activating-agent.html)

        AgentName:

          description: >-

            reference that is used to identify the agent in the console\.

        SubnetArns:
          type: array
          description: >-
            The Amazon Resource Names \(ARNs\) of the subnets in which DataSync
            will create elastic network interfaces for each data transfer task\.
            The agent that runs a task must be private\. When you start a task
            that is associated with an agent created in a VPC, or one that has
            access to an IP address in a VPC, then the task is also private\. In
            this case, DataSync creates four network interfaces for each task in
            your subnet\. For a data transfer to work, the agent must be able to
            route to all these four network interfaces\.

            characters for key and value are letters, spaces, and numbers

            EFS file system\.   If you specify an access point using
            `AccessPointArn` or an IAM role using `FileSystemAccessRoleArn`, you
            must set this parameter to `TLS1_2`\.

            where DataSync reads or writes data \(depending on if this is a
            source or destination location\)\. By default, DataSync uses the
            root directory, but you can also include subdirectories\.   You must
            specify a value with forward slashes \(for example,
            `/path/to/folder`\)\.

            The subdirectory in the NFS file system that is used to read data
            from the NFS source location or write data to the NFS destination\.
            The NFS path should be a path that's exported by the NFS server, or
            a subdirectory of that path\. The path should be such that it can be
            mounted by other NFS clients in your network\.    To see all the
            paths exported by your NFS server, run "`showmount -e
            nfs-server-name`" from an NFS client that has access to your
            server\. You can specify any directory that appears in the results,
            and any subdirectory of that directory\. Ensure that the NFS export
            is accessible without Kerberos authentication\.    To transfer all
            the data in the folder you specified, DataSync needs to have
            permissions to read all the data\. To ensure this, either configure
            the NFS export with `no_root_squash,` or ensure that the permissions
            for all of the files that you want DataSync allow read access for
            all users\. Doing either enables the agent to read the files\. For
            the agent to access directories, you must additionally enable all
            execute access\.   If you are copying data to or from your AWS
            Snowcone device, see [NFS Server on AWS
            Snowcone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/datasync/latest/userguide/create-nfs-location.html#nfs-on-snowcone)

            configuration, see [18\.7\. The /etc/exports Configuration
