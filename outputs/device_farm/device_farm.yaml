            The number of devices that Device Farm can add to your device pool\.
            Device Farm adds devices that are available and meet the criteria
            that you assign for the `rules` parameter\. Depending on how many
            devices meet these constraints, your device pool might contain fewer
            devices than the value for this parameter\.   By specifying the
            maximum number of devices, you can control the costs that you incur
            by running tests\.
