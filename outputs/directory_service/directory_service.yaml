            Specifies an alias for a directory and assigns the alias to the
            directory\. The alias is used to construct the access URL for the
            directory, such as `http://<alias>.awsapps.com`\. By default, AWS
            CloudFormation does not create an alias\.   After an alias has been
            created, it cannot be deleted or reused, so this operation should
            only be used when absolutely necessary\.

            AWS Managed Microsoft AD is available in two editions: `Standard`

          description: >-
            Whether to enable single sign\-on for a Microsoft Active Directory
            in AWS\. Single sign\-on allows users in your directory to access
            certain AWS services from a computer joined to the directory without
            having to enter their credentials separately\. If you don't specify
            a value, AWS CloudFormation disables single sign\-on by default\.
        Name:

            The fully qualified domain name for the AWS Managed Microsoft AD
            directory, such as `corp.example.com`\. This name will resolve
            inside your VPC only\. It does not need to be publicly resolvable\.
        Password:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The password for the default administrative user named `Admin`\.  
            If you need to change the password for the administrator account,

            [ResetUserPassword](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/devguide/API_ResetUserPassword.html)
            API call in the *AWS Directory Service API Reference*\.

          type: string
          description: >-
            The NetBIOS name for your domain, such as `CORP`\. If you don't
            specify a NetBIOS name, it will default to the first part of your
            directory DNS\. For example, `CORP` for the directory DNS
            `corp.example.com`\.
