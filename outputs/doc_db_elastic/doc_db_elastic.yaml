            The name of the Amazon DocumentDB elastic clusters administrator\.  
            + Must be from 1 to 63 letters or numbers\. + The first character
            must be a letter\. + Cannot be a reserved word\.
        AdminUserPassword:

            The authentication type used to determine where to fetch the
            password used for accessing the elastic cluster\. Valid types are
            `PLAIN_TEXT` or `SECRET_ARN`\.
        ClusterName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the new elastic cluster\. This parameter is stored as a

          type: string
          description: >-
            The KMS key identifier to use to encrypt the new elastic cluster\.  
            The KMS key identifier is the Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) for the
            KMS encryption key\. If you are creating a cluster using the same
            Amazon account that owns this KMS encryption key, you can use the
            KMS key alias instead of the ARN as the KMS encryption key\.   If an
            encryption key is not specified, Amazon DocumentDB uses the default
            encryption key that KMS creates for your account\. Your account has
            a different default encryption key for each Amazon Region\.
