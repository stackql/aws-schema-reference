    Experiment:
      type: object
      properties:
        Description:
          type: string
          description: An optional description of the experiment\.
        MetricGoals:
          type: >-
            list of
            [metricgoalobject](aws-properties-evidently-experiment-metricgoalobject.md)
          description: >-
            An array of structures that defines the metrics used for the
            experiment, and whether a higher or lower value for each metric is
            the goal\. You can use up to three metrics in an experiment\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: A name for the new experiment\.
        OnlineAbConfig:
          type: >-
            [onlineabconfigobject](aws-properties-evidently-experiment-onlineabconfigobject.md)
          description: >-
            A structure that contains the configuration of which variation to
            use as the "control" version\. The "control" version is used for
            comparison with other variations\. This structure also specifies how
            much experiment traffic is allocated to each variation\.
        Project:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name or the ARN of the project where this experiment is to be
            created\.
        RandomizationSalt:
          type: string
          description: >-
            When Evidently assigns a particular user session to an experiment,
            it must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user
            session is served\. This randomization ID is a combination of the
            entity ID and `randomizationSalt`\. If you omit `randomizationSalt`,
            Evidently uses the experiment name as the `randomizationSalt`\.
        RemoveSegment:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Set this to `true` to remove the segment that is associated with
            this experiment\. You can't use this parameter if the experiment is
            currently running\.
        RunningStatus:
          type: >-
            [runningstatusobject](aws-properties-evidently-experiment-runningstatusobject.md)
          description: A structure that you can use to start and stop the experiment\.
        SamplingRate:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The portion of the available audience that you want to allocate to
            this experiment, in thousandths of a percent\. The available
            audience is the total audience minus the audience that you have
            allocated to overrides or current launches of this feature\.   This
            is represented in thousandths of a percent\. For example, specify
            10,000 to allocate 10% of the available audience\.
        Segment:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies an audience *segment* to use in the experiment\. When a
            segment is used in an experiment, only user sessions that match the
            segment pattern are used in the experiment\.   For more information,
            see [ Segment rule pattern
            syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments-syntax.html)\.
        Tags:

            list of
            [tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html)
          description: >-
            Assigns one or more tags \(key\-value pairs\) to the experiment\.  
            Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources\. You can
            also use them to scope user permissions by granting a user
            permission to access or change only resources with certain tag
            values\.   Tags don't have any semantic meaning to AWS and are
            interpreted strictly as strings of characters\.   You can associate
            as many as 50 tags with an experiment\.   For more information, see
            [Tagging AWS
            resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html)\.

            default variation is served to users who are not allocated to any
            ongoing launches or experiments of this feature\.   This variation
            must also be listed in the `Variations` structure\.   If you omit
            `DefaultVariation`, the first variation listed in the `Variations`
            structure is used as the default variation\.
        Description:

            When Evidently assigns a particular user session to a launch, it
            must use a randomization ID to determine which variation the user

            Use this parameter if the project will use *client\-side evaluation
            powered by AWS AppConfig*\. Client\-side evaluation allows your
            application to assign variations to user sessions locally instead of
            by calling the
            [EvaluateFeature](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatchevidently/latest/APIReference/API_EvaluateFeature.html)
            operation\. This mitigates the latency and availability risks that
            come with an API call\. For more information, see [ Use client\-side

            AppConfig\.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-client-side-evaluation.html)  
            This parameter is a structure that contains information about the
            AWS AppConfig application that will be used as for client\-side
            evaluation\.   To create a project that uses client\-side
            evaluation, you must have the

            store evaluation events for longer term storage, if you choose to do
            so\. If you choose not to store these events, Evidently deletes them
            after using them to produce metrics and other experiment results
            that you can view\.   You can't specify both `CloudWatchLogs` and
            `S3Destination` in the same operation\.
