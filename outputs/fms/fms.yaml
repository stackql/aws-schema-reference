          description: >-
            Used when deleting a policy\. If `true`, Firewall Manager performs
            cleanup according to the policy type\.   For AWS WAF and Shield
            Advanced policies, Firewall Manager does the following:   + Deletes
            rule groups created by Firewall Manager + Removes web ACLs from
            in\-scope resources  + Deletes web ACLs that contain no rules or
            rule groups  For security group policies, Firewall Manager does the
            following for each security group in the policy:   + Disassociates
            the security group from in\-scope resources  + Deletes the security
            group if it was created through Firewall Manager and if it's no
            longer associated with any resources through another policy  After
            the cleanup, in\-scope resources are no longer protected by web ACLs
            in this policy\. Protection of out\-of\-scope resources remains
            unchanged\. Scope is determined by tags that you create and accounts
            that you associate with the policy\. When creating the policy, if
            you specify that only resources in specific accounts or with
            specific tags are in scope of the policy, those accounts and
            resources are handled by the policy\. All others are out of scope\.
            If you don't specify tags or accounts, all resources are in scope\.
        ExcludeMap:
          type: '[iemap](aws-properties-fms-policy-iemap.md)'
          description: >-
            Specifies the AWS account IDs and AWS Organizations organizational
            units \(OUs\) to exclude from the policy\. Specifying an OU is the
            equivalent of specifying all accounts in the OU and in any of its
            child OUs, including any child OUs and accounts that are added at a
            later time\.   You can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not
            both\. If you specify an `IncludeMap`, AWS Firewall Manager applies
            the policy to all accounts specified by the `IncludeMap`, and does
            not evaluate any `ExcludeMap` specifications\. If you do not specify
            an `IncludeMap`, then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all
            accounts except for those specified by the `ExcludeMap`\.   You can
            specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:    + Specify account IDs
            by setting the key to `ACCOUNT`\. For example, the following is a
            valid map: `{“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”]}`\. + Specify
            OUs by setting the key to `ORGUNIT`\. For example, the following is
            a valid map: `{“ORGUNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]}`\. + Specify
            accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma\.
            For example, the following is a valid map: `{“ACCOUNT” :
            [“accountID1”, “accountID2”], “ORGUNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]}`\.
        ExcludeResourceTags:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Used only when tags are specified in the `ResourceTags` property\.
            If this property is `True`, resources with the specified tags are
            not in scope of the policy\. If it's `False`, only resources with
            the specified tags are in scope of the policy\.
        IncludeMap:
          type: '[iemap](aws-properties-fms-policy-iemap.md)'
          description: >-
            Specifies the AWS account IDs and AWS Organizations organizational
            units \(OUs\) to include in the policy\. Specifying an OU is the

        RemediationEnabled:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Indicates if the policy should be automatically applied to new
            resources\.
        ResourcesCleanUp:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Indicates whether AWS Firewall Manager should automatically remove
            protections from resources that leave the policy scope and clean up
            resources that Firewall Manager is managing for accounts when those
            accounts leave policy scope\. For example, Firewall Manager will
            disassociate a Firewall Manager managed web ACL from a protected
            customer resource when the customer resource leaves policy
            scope\.    By default, Firewall Manager doesn't remove protections
            or delete Firewall Manager managed resources\.    This option is not
            available for Shield Advanced or AWS WAF Classic policies\.
        ResourceSetIds:
          type: array

        ResourceTags:
          type: list of [resourcetag](aws-properties-fms-policy-resourcetag.md)
          description: >-
            An array of `ResourceTag` objects, used to explicitly include
            resources in the policy scope or explicitly exclude them\. If this
            isn't set, then tags aren't used to modify policy scope\. See also
            `ExcludeResourceTags`\.
        ResourceType:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The type of resource protected by or in scope of the policy\. This
            is in the format shown in the [AWS Resource Types
            Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)\.
            To apply this policy to multiple resource types, specify a resource
            type of `ResourceTypeList` and then specify the resource types in a
            `ResourceTypeList`\.   For AWS WAF and Shield Advanced, example
            resource types include `AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer`
            and `AWS::CloudFront::Distribution`\. For a security group common
            policy, valid values are `AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface` and
            `AWS::EC2::Instance`\. For a security group content audit policy,
            valid values are `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`,
            `AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface`, and `AWS::EC2::Instance`\. For a
            security group usage audit policy, the value is
            `AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup`\. For an AWS Network Firewall policy or
            DNS Firewall policy, the value is `AWS::EC2::VPC`\.
        ResourceTypeList:
          type: array
          description: >-
            An array of `ResourceType` objects\. Use this only to specify
            multiple resource types\. To specify a single resource type, use
            `ResourceType`\.
        SecurityServicePolicyData:
          description: >-
            Details about the security service that is being used to protect the
            resources\.   This contains the following settings:    + Type \-
            Indicates the service type that the policy uses to protect the
            resource\. For security group policies, Firewall Manager supports
            one security group for each common policy and for each content audit
            policy\. This is an adjustable limit that you can increase by
            contacting AWS Support\.

            AWS WAF Classic doesn't support rule groups in CloudFront\. To
            create a WAF Classic policy through CloudFormation, create your rule
            groups outside of CloudFront, then provide the rule group IDs in the
            WAF managed service data specification\.
        Tags:
          type: list of [policytag](aws-properties-fms-policy-policytag.md)
          description: >-
            A collection of key:value pairs associated with an AWS resource\.
            The key:value pair can be anything you define\. Typically, the tag
            key represents a category \(such as "environment"\) and the tag
            value represents a specific value within that category \(such as
            "test," "development," or "production"\)\. You can add up to 50 tags
            to each AWS resource\.
