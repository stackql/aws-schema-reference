        BatchImportMetaDataOnCreate:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            A boolean flag indicating whether an import data repository task to
            import metadata should run after the data repository association is
            created\. The task runs if this flag is set to `true`\.
        DataRepositoryPath:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The path to the Amazon S3 data repository that will be linked to the
            file system\. The path can be an S3 bucket or prefix in the format
            `s3://myBucket/myPrefix/`\. This path specifies where in the S3 data
            repository files will be imported from or exported to\.
        FileSystemId:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The ID of the file system on which the data repository association
            is configured\.
        FileSystemPath:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A path on the Amazon FSx for Lustre file system that points to a
            high\-level directory \(such as `/ns1/`\) or subdirectory \(such as
            `/ns1/subdir/`\) that will be mapped 1\-1 with
            `DataRepositoryPath`\. The leading forward slash in the name is
            required\. Two data repository associations cannot have overlapping
            file system paths\. For example, if a data repository is associated
            with file system path `/ns1/`, then you cannot link another data
            repository with file system path `/ns1/ns2`\.   This path specifies
            where in your file system files will be exported from or imported
            to\. This file system directory can be linked to only one Amazon S3
            bucket, and no other S3 bucket can be linked to the directory\.   If
            you specify only a forward slash \(`/`\) as the file system path,
            you can link only one data repository to the file system\. You can
            only specify "/" as the file system path for the first data
            repository associated with a file system\.
        ImportedFileChunkSize:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            For files imported from a data repository, this value determines the
            stripe count and maximum amount of data per file \(in MiB\) stored
            on a single physical disk\. The maximum number of disks that a
            single file can be striped across is limited by the total number of
            disks that make up the file system or cache\.   The default chunk
            size is 1,024 MiB \(1 GiB\) and can go as high as 512,000 MiB \(500
            GiB\)\. Amazon S3 objects have a maximum size of 5 TB\.
        S3:
          type: '[s3](aws-properties-fsx-datarepositoryassociation-s3.md)'
          description: >-
            The configuration for an Amazon S3 data repository linked to an
            Amazon FSx Lustre file system with a data repository association\.
            The configuration defines which file events \(new, changed, or
            deleted files or directories\) are automatically imported from the
            linked data repository to the file system or automatically exported
            from the file system to the data repository\.

            `StorageCapacity` is required if you are creating a new file
            system\.   **FSx for Lustre file systems** \- The amount of storage
            capacity that you can configure depends on the value that you set
            for `StorageType` and the Lustre `DeploymentType`, as follows:   +
            For `SCRATCH_2`, `PERSISTENT_2` and `PERSISTENT_1` deployment types

            \- The amount of storage capacity that you can configure is from 64
            GiB up to 524,288 GiB \(512 TiB\)\. If you are creating a file
            system from a backup, you can specify a storage capacity equal to or
