    Accelerator:
      type: object
      properties:
        Enabled:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Indicates whether the accelerator is enabled\. The value is true or
            false\. The default value is true\.    If the value is set to true,
            the accelerator cannot be deleted\. If set to false, accelerator can
            be deleted\.
        IpAddresses:
          type: array
          description: >-
            Optionally, if you've added your own IP address pool to Global
            Accelerator \(BYOIP\), you can choose IP addresses from your own
            pool to use for the accelerator's static IP addresses when you
            create an accelerator\. You can specify one or two addresses,
            separated by a comma\. Do not include the /32 suffix\.   Only one IP
            address from each of your IP address ranges can be used for each
            accelerator\. If you specify only one IP address from your IP
            address range, Global Accelerator assigns a second static IP address
            for the accelerator from the AWS IP address pool\.    Note that you
            can't update IP addresses for an existing accelerator\. To change
            them, you must create a new accelerator with the new addresses\.  
            For more information, see [Bring Your Own IP Addresses
            \(BYOIP\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/using-byoip.html)

        IpAddressType:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The IP address type that an accelerator supports\. For a standard
            accelerator, the value can be IPV4 or DUAL\_STACK\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the accelerator\. The name must contain only
            alphanumeric characters or hyphens \(\-\), and must not begin or end
            with a hyphen\.
        Tags:
          type: >-

            list of

        EndpointGroupRegion:
          type: string
          description: The AWS Regions where the endpoint group is located\.
        HealthCheckIntervalSeconds:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each
            endpoint\. The default value is 30\.
        HealthCheckPath:
          type: string
          description: >-
            If the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path
            that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints
            for health checks\. The default is slash \(/\)\.
        HealthCheckPort:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on
            endpoints that are part of this endpoint group\.    The default port
            is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated
            with\. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the
            first specified port in the list of ports\.
        HealthCheckProtocol:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks
            on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group\. The default
            value is TCP\.
        ListenerArn:
          type: string
          description: The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the listener\.
        PortOverrides:
          type: >-
            list of
            [portoverride](aws-properties-globalaccelerator-endpointgroup-portoverride.md)
          description: >-
            Allows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic
            to an endpoint\. Using a port override lets you map a list of
            external destination ports \(that your users send traffic to\) to a
            list of internal destination ports that you want an application
            endpoint to receive traffic on\.
        ThresholdCount:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of
            a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to
            healthy\. The default value is 3\.
        TrafficDialPercentage:
          type: double
          description: >-
            The percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Regions\. Additional
            traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this
            listener\.    Use this action to increase \(dial up\) or decrease
            \(dial down\) traffic to a specific Region\. The percentage is
            applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the
            Region based on optimal routing\.   The default value is 100\.
      required:
        - EndpointGroupRegion
        - ListenerArn
    Listener:
      type: object
      properties:
        AcceleratorArn:
          type: string
          description: The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of your accelerator\.
        ClientAffinity:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Client affinity lets you direct all requests from a user to the same
            endpoint, if you have stateful applications, regardless of the port
            and protocol of the client request\. Client affinity gives you
            control over whether to always route each client to the same
            specific endpoint\.   AWS Global Accelerator uses a consistent\-flow
            hashing algorithm to choose the optimal endpoint for a connection\.
            If client affinity is `NONE`, Global Accelerator uses the
            "five\-tuple" \(5\-tuple\) properties—source IP address, source
            port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to
            select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint\. However,
            with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to
            Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to
            the same endpoint because the hash value changes\.    If you want a
            given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client
            affinity to `SOURCE_IP` instead\. When you use the `SOURCE_IP`
            setting, Global Accelerator uses the "two\-tuple" \(2\-tuple\)
            properties— source \(client\) IP address and destination IP
            address—to select the hash value\.   The default value is `NONE`\.

            accelerator\.
