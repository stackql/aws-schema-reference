    Workspace:
      type: object
      properties:
        AccountAccessType:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies whether the workspace can access AWS resources in this AWS
            account only, or whether it can also access AWS resources in other
            accounts in the same organization\. If this is `ORGANIZATION`, the
            `workspaceOrganizationalUnits` parameter specifies which
            organizational units the workspace can access\.
        AuthenticationProviders:
          type: array
          description: >-
            Specifies whether this workspace uses SAML 2\.0, AWS IAM Identity
            Center \(successor to AWS Single Sign\-On\), or both to authenticate
            users for using the Grafana console within a workspace\. For more
            information, see [User authentication in Amazon Managed
            Grafana](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/authentication-in-AMG.html)\.
        ClientToken:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A unique, case\-sensitive, user\-provided identifier to ensure the
            idempotency of the request\.
        DataSources:
          type: array
          description: >-
            Specifies the AWS data sources that have been configured to have IAM
            roles and permissions created to allow Amazon Managed Grafana to
            read data from these sources\.   This list is only used when the
            workspace was created through the AWS console, and the
            `permissionType` is `SERVICE_MANAGED`\.
        Description:
          type: string
          description: The user\-defined description of the workspace\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: The name of the workspace\.
        NotificationDestinations:
          type: array
          description: >-
            The AWS notification channels that Amazon Managed Grafana can
            automatically create IAM roles and permissions for, to allow Amazon
            Managed Grafana to use these channels\.
        OrganizationalUnits:
          type: array
          description: >-
            Specifies the organizational units that this workspace is allowed to
            use data sources from, if this workspace is in an account that is
            part of an organization\.
        OrganizationRoleName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the IAM role that is used to access resources through
            Organizations\.
        PermissionType:
          type: string
          description: >-
            If this is `SERVICE_MANAGED`, and the workplace was created through
            the Amazon Managed Grafana console, then Amazon Managed Grafana
            automatically creates the IAM roles and provisions the permissions
            that the workspace needs to use AWS data sources and notification
            channels\.   If this is `CUSTOMER_MANAGED`, you must manage those
            roles and permissions yourself\.   If you are working with a
            workspace in a member account of an organization and that account is
            not a delegated administrator account, and you want the workspace to
            access data sources in other AWS accounts in the organization, this
            parameter must be set to `CUSTOMER_MANAGED`\.   For more information
            about converting between customer and service managed, see [Managing
            permissions for data sources and notification
            channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-datasource-and-notification.html)\.
            For more information about the roles and permissions that must be
            managed for customer managed workspaces, see [Amazon Managed Grafana
            permissions and policies for AWS data sources and notification
            channels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/grafana/latest/userguide/AMG-manage-permissions.html)
        RoleArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The IAM role that grants permissions to the AWS resources that the
            workspace will view data from\. This role must already exist\.
        SamlConfiguration:
          type: >-
            [samlconfiguration](aws-properties-grafana-workspace-samlconfiguration.md)
          description: >-
            If the workspace uses SAML, use this structure to map SAML assertion
            attributes to workspace user information and define which groups in
            the assertion attribute are to have the `Admin` and `Editor` roles
            in the workspace\.
        StackSetName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the AWS CloudFormation stack set that is used to
            generate IAM roles to be used for this workspace\.
