            specify component content up to your service quota\.  
            Alternatively, you can specify the YAML document inline, using the

        Version:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The semantic version of the container recipe\.   The semantic
            version has four nodes: <major>\.<minor>\.<patch>/<build>\. You can
            assign values for the first three, and can filter on all of
            them\.    **Assignment:** For the first three nodes you can assign
            any positive integer value, including zero, with an upper limit of
            2^30\-1, or 1073741823 for each node\. Image Builder automatically
            assigns the build number to the fourth node\.    **Patterns:** You
            can use any numeric pattern that adheres to the assignment
            requirements for the nodes that you can assign\. For example, you
            might choose a software version pattern, such as 1\.0\.0, or a date,
            such as 2021\.01\.01\.    **Filtering:** With semantic versioning,
            you have the flexibility to use wildcards \(x\) to specify the most
            recent versions or nodes when selecting the base image or components
            for your recipe\. When you use a wildcard in any node, all nodes to
            the right of the first wildcard must also be wildcards\.
