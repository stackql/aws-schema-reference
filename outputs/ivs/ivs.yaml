            Channel latency mode\. Valid values:   +  `NORMAL`: Use NORMAL to
            broadcast and deliver live video up to Full HD\. +  `LOW`: Use LOW
            for near real\-time interactions with viewers\. In the Amazon IVS
            console, `LOW` and `NORMAL` correspond to `Ultra-low` and
            `Standard`, respectively\.

            indicates that recording is disabled for the channel\. A
            RecordingConfiguration ARN indicates that recording is enabled using
            the specified recording configuration\. See the [

            The channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and
            bitrate\. *If you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the
            stream probably will disconnect immediately\.* Valid values:   + 
            `STANDARD`: Video is transcoded: multiple qualities are generated
            from the original input to automatically give viewers the best
            experience for their devices and network conditions\. Transcoding
            allows higher playback quality across a range of download speeds\.
            Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8\.5 Mbps\.
            Audio is transcoded only for renditions 360p and below; above that,
            audio is passed through\. +  `BASIC`: Video is transmuxed: Amazon
            IVS delivers the original input to viewers\. The viewerâ€™s
            video\-quality choice is limited to the original input\. Resolution
            can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 1\.5 Mbps for 480p and
            up to 3\.5 Mbps for resolutions between 480p and 1080p\.
