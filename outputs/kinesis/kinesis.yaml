    Stream:
      type: object
      properties:
        Name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the Kinesis stream\. If you don't specify a name, AWS
            CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for
            the stream name\. For more information, see [Name
            Type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-name.html)\.   
            If you specify a name, you cannot perform updates that require
            replacement of this resource\. You can perform updates that require
            no or some interruption\. If you must replace the resource, specify
            a new name\.
        RetentionPeriodHours:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The number of hours for the data records that are stored in shards
            to remain accessible\. The default value is 24\. For more
            information about the stream retention period, see [Changing the
            Data Retention
            Period](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-extended-retention.html)
            in the Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide\.
        ShardCount:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The number of shards that the stream uses\. For greater provisioned
            throughput, increase the number of shards\.
        StreamEncryption:
          type: >-
            [streamencryption](aws-properties-kinesis-stream-streamencryption.md)
          description: >-
            When specified, enables or updates server\-side encryption using an
            AWS KMS key for a specified stream\. Removing this property from
            your stack template and updating your stack disables encryption\.
        StreamModeDetails:
          type: >-
            [streammodedetails](aws-properties-kinesis-stream-streammodedetails.md)
          description: >-
            Specifies the capacity mode to which you want to set your data
            stream\. Currently, in Kinesis Data Streams, you can choose between
            an **on\-demand** capacity mode and a **provisioned** capacity mode
            for your data streams\.
        Tags:
          type: >-
            list of
            [tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html)
          description: >-
            An arbitrary set of tags \(keyâ€“value pairs\) to associate with the
            Kinesis stream\. For information about constraints for this
            property, see [Tag
            Restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/tagging.html#tagging-restrictions)
            in the *Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide*\.
    StreamConsumer:
      type: object
      properties:
        ConsumerName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the consumer is something you choose when you register
            the consumer\.
        StreamARN:
          type: string
          description: The ARN of the stream with which you registered the consumer\.
      required:
        - ConsumerName
        - StreamARN
