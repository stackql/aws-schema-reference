          description: >-
            One or more SQL statements that read input data, transform it, and
            generate output\. For example, you can write a SQL statement that
            reads data from one in\-application stream, generates a running
            average of the number of advertisement clicks by vendor, and insert
            resulting rows in another in\-application stream using pumps\. For
            more information about the typical pattern, see [Application
            Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesisanalytics/latest/dev/how-it-works-app-code.html)\.   
            You can provide such series of SQL statements, where output of one
            statement can be used as the input for the next statement\. You
            store intermediate results by creating in\-application streams and
            pumps\.   Note that the application code must create the streams
            with names specified in the `Outputs`\. For example, if your
            `Outputs` defines output streams named `ExampleOutputStream1` and
            `ExampleOutputStream2`, then your application code must create these
            streams\.

          description: >-
            Use this parameter to configure the application input\.   You can
            configure your application to receive input from a single streaming
            source\. In this configuration, you map this streaming source to an
            in\-application stream that is created\. Your application code can
            then query the in\-application stream like a table \(you can think
            of it as a constantly updating table\)\.   For the streaming source,
            you provide its Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) and format of data on
            the stream \(for example, JSON, CSV, etc\.\)\. You also must provide
            an IAM role that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume to read this
            stream on your behalf\.   To create the in\-application stream, you
            need to specify a schema to transform your data into a schematized
            version used in SQL\. In the schema, you provide the necessary
            mapping of the data elements in the streaming source to record
            columns in the in\-app stream\.

            An array of objects, each describing one output configuration\. In
            the output configuration, you specify the name of an in\-application
            stream, a destination \(that is, an Amazon Kinesis stream, an Amazon
            Kinesis Firehose delivery stream, or an AWS Lambda function\), and
            record the formation to use when writing to the destination\.

            The reference data source can be an object in your Amazon S3
            bucket\. Amazon Kinesis Analytics reads the object and copies the
            data into the in\-application table that is created\. You provide an
            S3 bucket, object key name, and the resulting in\-application table
            that is created\. You must also provide an IAM role with the
            necessary permissions that Amazon Kinesis Analytics can assume to
            read the object from your S3 bucket on your behalf\.
