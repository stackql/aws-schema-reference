          description: >-
            Specifies the position filtering for the tracker resource\.   Valid
            values:   +  `TimeBased` \- Location updates are evaluated against
            linked geofence collections, but not every location update is
            stored\. If your update frequency is more often than 30 seconds,
            only one update per 30 seconds is stored for each unique device
            ID\.  +  `DistanceBased` \- If the device has moved less than 30 m
            \(98\.4 ft\), location updates are ignored\. Location updates within
            this area are neither evaluated against linked geofence collections,
            nor stored\. This helps control costs by reducing the number of
            geofence evaluations and historical device positions to paginate
            through\. Distance\-based filtering can also reduce the effects of
            GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map\.  + 
            `AccuracyBased` \- If the device has moved less than the measured
            accuracy, location updates are ignored\. For example, if two
            consecutive updates from a device have a horizontal accuracy of 5 m
            and 10 m, the second update is ignored if the device has moved less
            than 15 m\. Ignored location updates are neither evaluated against
            linked geofence collections, nor stored\. This can reduce the
            effects of GPS noise when displaying device trajectories on a map,
            and can help control your costs by reducing the number of geofence
            evaluations\.  This field is optional\. If not specified, the
            default value is `TimeBased`\.
