      type: object
      properties:
        DataDelayOffsetInMinutes:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            A period of time \(in minutes\) by which inference on the data is
            delayed after the data starts\. For instance, if an offset delay
            time of five minutes was selected, inference will not begin on the
            data until the first data measurement after the five minute mark\.
            For example, if five minutes is selected, the inference scheduler
            will wake up at the configured frequency with the additional five
            minute delay time to check the customer S3 bucket\. The customer can
            upload data at the same frequency and they don't need to stop and
            restart the scheduler when uploading new data\.
        DataInputConfiguration:
          type: >-
            [datainputconfiguration](aws-properties-lookoutequipment-inferencescheduler-datainputconfiguration.md)
          description: >-
            Specifies configuration information for the input data for the
            inference scheduler, including delimiter, format, and dataset
            location\.
        DataOutputConfiguration:
          type: >-
            [dataoutputconfiguration](aws-properties-lookoutequipment-inferencescheduler-dataoutputconfiguration.md)
          description: >-
            Specifies configuration information for the output results for the
            inference scheduler, including the Amazon S3 location for the
            output\.
        DataUploadFrequency:
          type: string
          description: >-
            How often data is uploaded to the source S3 bucket for the input
            data\. This value is the length of time between data uploads\. For
            instance, if you select 5 minutes, Amazon Lookout for Equipment will
            upload the real\-time data to the source bucket once every 5
            minutes\. This frequency also determines how often Amazon Lookout
            for Equipment starts a scheduled inference on your data\. In this
            example, it starts once every 5 minutes\.
        InferenceSchedulerName:

        ModelName:
          type: string
          description: The name of the ML model used for the inference scheduler\.
        RoleArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of a role with permission to access
            the data source being used for the inference\.
        ServerSideKmsKeyId:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Provides the identifier of the AWS KMS key used to encrypt inference
            scheduler data by Amazon Lookout for Equipment\.
