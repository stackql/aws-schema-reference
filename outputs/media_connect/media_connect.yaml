            Classless Inter\-Domain Routing \(CIDR\) block; for example,
            10\.0\.0\.0/16\. This is the primary CIDR block for your VPC\. When
            you create a subnet for your VPC, you specify the CIDR block for the
            subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block\.   The subnets that
            you use across all VPC interfaces on the flow must be in the same
            Availability Zone as the flow\.
