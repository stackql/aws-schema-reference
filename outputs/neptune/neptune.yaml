          description: >-
            Creates a new DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster
            snapshot\.   If a DB snapshot is specified, the target DB cluster is
            created from the source DB snapshot with a default configuration and
            default security group\.   If a DB cluster snapshot is specified,
            the target DB cluster is created from the source DB cluster restore
            point with the same configuration as the original source DB cluster,
            except that the new DB cluster is created with the default security
            group\.
        RestoreType:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Creates a new DB cluster from a DB snapshot or DB cluster

          description: >-
            Specifies the identifier for a DB cluster snapshot\. Must match the
            identifier of an existing snapshot\.   After you restore a DB
            cluster using a `SnapshotIdentifier`, you must specify the same
            `SnapshotIdentifier` for any future updates to the DB cluster\. When
            you specify this property for an update, the DB cluster is not
            restored from the snapshot again, and the data in the database is
            not changed\.   However, if you don't specify the
            `SnapshotIdentifier`, an empty DB cluster is created, and the
            original DB cluster is deleted\. If you specify a property that is
            different from the previous snapshot restore property, the DB
            cluster is restored from the snapshot specified by the
            `SnapshotIdentifier`, and the original DB cluster is deleted\.

            group\.
        StorageEncrypted:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Indicates whether the DB cluster is encrypted\.   If you specify the
            `DBClusterIdentifier`, `DBSnapshotIdentifier`, or
            `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` property, don't specify this property\.
            The value is inherited from the cluster, snapshot, or source DB
            instance\. If you specify the `KmsKeyId` property, you must enable
            encryption\.   If you specify the `KmsKeyId`, you must enable
            encryption by setting `StorageEncrypted` to true\.

            parameter doesn't result in an outage and the change is
            asynchronously applied as soon as possible\. This parameter must be
            set to true when specifying a value for the EngineVersion parameter

            changed during an update, the DB instance might need to be
            restarted, which causes some interruption\. If the parameter group
            contains static parameters, whether they were changed or not, an
            update triggers a reboot\.
        DBSnapshotIdentifier:
          type: string
