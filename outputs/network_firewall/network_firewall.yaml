            A flag indicating whether it is possible to delete the firewall\. A
            setting of `TRUE` indicates that the firewall is protected against
            deletion\. Use this setting to protect against accidentally deleting
            a firewall that is in use\. When you create a firewall, the
            operation initializes this flag to `TRUE`\.

          description: >-
            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against a
            change to the firewall policy association\. Use this setting to
            protect against accidentally modifying the firewall policy for a
            firewall that is in use\. When you create a firewall, the operation
            initializes this setting to `TRUE`\.
        SubnetChangeProtection:

          description: >-
            A setting indicating whether the firewall is protected against
            changes to the subnet associations\. Use this setting to protect
            against accidentally modifying the subnet associations for a
            firewall that is in use\. When you create a firewall, the operation
