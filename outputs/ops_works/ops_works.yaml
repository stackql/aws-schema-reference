            cases\. Exceeding it will cause an exception with the message,
            "Environment: is too large \(maximum is 20KB\)\."   If you have

            layer\. For example, PHP applications are associated with a PHP
            layer\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks deploys an application to those
            instances that are members of the corresponding layer\. If your app
            isn't one of the standard types, or you prefer to implement your own

            update the agent version, edit the instance configuration and
            specify a new version\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks installs that version on
            the instance\. The default setting is `INHERIT`\. To specify an
            agent version, you must use the complete version number, not the

            [CreateDeployment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/opsworks-2013-02-18/CreateDeployment)
            to run the `update_dependencies` stack command or by manually
            running `yum` \(Amazon Linux\) or `apt-get` \(Ubuntu\) on the
            instances\.    We strongly recommend using the default value of

            action's AmiId parameter to specify the custom AMI that you want to
            use\. Block device mappings are not supported if the value is

            the VPC\. The following are valid values for this parameter:
            `dedicated`, `default`, or `host`\. Because there are costs
            associated with changes in tenancy options, we recommend that you
            research tenancy options before choosing them for your instances\.

            following options:   + Auto\-update \- Set this parameter to
            `LATEST`\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically installs new agent
            versions on the stack's instances as soon as they are available\. +
            Fixed version \- Set this parameter to your preferred agent
            version\. To update the agent version, you must edit the stack
            configuration and specify a new version\. AWS OpsWorks Stacks
            installs that version on the stack's instances\. The default setting
            is the most recent release of the agent\. To specify an agent
            version, you must use the complete version number, not the
            abbreviated number shown on the console\. For a list of available
            agent version numbers, call
            [DescribeAgentVersions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/opsworks-2013-02-18/DescribeAgentVersions)\.
            AgentVersion cannot be set to Chef 12\.2\.   You can also specify an
            agent version when you create or update an instance, which overrides
            the stack's default setting\.

          description: >-
            A default Amazon EC2 key pair name\. The default value is none\. If
            you specify a key pair name, AWS OpsWorks installs the public key on
            the instance and you can use the private key with an SSH client to

            Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/security-ssh-access.html)\.
            You can override this setting by specifying a different key pair, or
            no key pair, when you [ create an
            instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workinginstances-add.html)\.

        HostnameTheme:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The stack's host name theme, with spaces replaced by underscores\.
            The theme is used to generate host names for the stack's instances\.
            By default, `HostnameTheme` is set to `Layer_Dependent`, which
            creates host names by appending integers to the layer's short name\.
            The other themes are:   +  `Baked_Goods`  +  `Clouds`  + 
            `Europe_Cities`  +  `Fruits`  +  `Greek_Deities_and_Titans`  +

            before registering the database instance\.
        ServiceRoleArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The stack's IAM role, which allows AWS OpsWorks Stacks to work with

        UseOpsworksSecurityGroups:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Whether to associate the AWS OpsWorks Stacks built\-in security
            groups with the stack's layers\.    AWS OpsWorks Stacks provides a
            standard set of built\-in security groups, one for each layer, which
            are associated with layers by default\. With
            `UseOpsworksSecurityGroups` you can instead provide your own custom
            security groups\. `UseOpsworksSecurityGroups` has the following
            settings:    + True \- AWS OpsWorks Stacks automatically associates
            the appropriate built\-in security group with each layer \(default
            setting\)\. You can associate additional security groups with a
            layer after you create it, but you cannot delete the built\-in
            security group\. + False \- AWS OpsWorks Stacks does not associate
            built\-in security groups with layers\. You must create appropriate
            EC2 security groups and associate a security group with each layer
            that you create\. However, you can still manually associate a
            built\-in security group with a layer on creation; custom security
            groups are required only for those layers that need custom
            settings\. For more information, see [Create a New
            Stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/workingstacks-creating.html)\.
        VpcId:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The ID of the VPC that the stack is to be launched into\. The VPC
            must be in the stack's region\. All instances are launched into this
            VPC\. You cannot change the ID later\.   + If your account supports
            EC2\-Classic, the default value is `no VPC`\. + If your account does
            not support EC2\-Classic, the default value is the default VPC for
            the specified region\. If the VPC ID corresponds to a default VPC
            and you have specified either the `DefaultAvailabilityZone` or the
            `DefaultSubnetId` parameter only, AWS OpsWorks Stacks infers the
            value of the other parameter\. If you specify neither parameter, AWS
            OpsWorks Stacks sets these parameters to the first valid
            Availability Zone for the specified region and the corresponding
            default VPC subnet ID, respectively\.   If you specify a nondefault
            VPC ID, note the following:   + It must belong to a VPC in your
            account that is in the specified region\. + You must specify a value
            for `DefaultSubnetId`\. For more information about how to use AWS
