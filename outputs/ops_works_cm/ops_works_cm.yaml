        AssociatePublicIpAddress:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Associate a public IP address with a server that you are launching\.
            Valid values are `true` or `false`\. The default value is `true`\.
        BackupId:
          type: string
          description: >-
            If you specify this field, AWS OpsWorks CM creates the server by
            using the backup represented by BackupId\.
        BackupRetentionCount:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The number of automated backups that you want to keep\. Whenever a
            new backup is created, AWS OpsWorks CM deletes the oldest backups if
            this number is exceeded\. The default value is `1`\.
        CustomCertificate:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Supported on servers running Chef Automate 2\.0 only\. A
            PEM\-formatted HTTPS certificate\. The value can be be a single,
            self\-signed certificate, or a certificate chain\. If you specify a
            custom certificate, you must also specify values for `CustomDomain`
            and `CustomPrivateKey`\. The following are requirements for the
            `CustomCertificate` value:   + You can provide either a
            self\-signed, custom certificate, or the full certificate chain\. +
            The certificate must be a valid X509 certificate, or a certificate
            chain in PEM format\. + The certificate must be valid at the time of
            upload\. A certificate can't be used before its validity period
            begins \(the certificate's `NotBefore` date\), or after it expires
            \(the certificate's `NotAfter` date\)\. + The certificateâ€™s common
            name or subject alternative names \(SANs\), if present, must match
            the value of `CustomDomain`\. + The certificate must match the value
            of `CustomPrivateKey`\.
        CustomDomain:

            Supported on servers running Chef Automate 2\.0 only\. An optional
            public endpoint of a server, such as `https://aws.my-company.com`\.
            To access the server, create a CNAME DNS record in your preferred
            DNS service that points the custom domain to the endpoint that is
            generated when the server is created \(the value of the CreateServer
            Endpoint attribute\)\. You cannot access the server by using the
            generated `Endpoint` value if the server is using a custom domain\.
            If you specify a custom domain, you must also specify values for
            `CustomCertificate` and `CustomPrivateKey`\.
        CustomPrivateKey:
          type: string

            Supported on servers running Chef Automate 2\.0 only\. A private key
            in PEM format for connecting to the server by using HTTPS\. The
            private key must not be encrypted; it cannot be protected by a
            password or passphrase\. If you specify a custom private key, you
            must also specify values for `CustomDomain` and
            `CustomCertificate`\.

          description: >-
            **Attributes accepted in a Puppet createServer request:** + 
            `PUPPET_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: To work with the Puppet Enterprise console,
            a password must use ASCII characters\. +  `PUPPET_R10K_REMOTE`: The
            r10k remote is the URL of your control repository \(for example,

            Specifying an r10k remote opens TCP port 8170\. + 
            `PUPPET_R10K_PRIVATE_KEY`: If you are using a private Git

        PreferredBackupWindow:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The start time for a one\-hour period during which AWS OpsWorks CM
            backs up application\-level data on your server if automated backups
            are enabled\. Valid values must be specified in one of the following
            formats:    +  `HH:MM` for daily backups +  `DDD:HH:MM` for weekly
            backups  `MM` must be specified as `00`\. The specified time is in
            coordinated universal time \(UTC\)\. The default value is a random,
            daily start time\.    **Example:** `08:00`, which represents a daily
            start time of 08:00 UTC\.    **Example:** `Mon:08:00`, which
            represents a start time of every Monday at 08:00 UTC\. \(8:00

            If you add this parameter, the specified security groups must be
            within the VPC that is specified by `SubnetIds`\.     If you do not
            specify this parameter, AWS OpsWorks CM creates one new security
            group that uses TCP ports 22 and 443, open to 0\.0\.0\.0/0
            \(everyone\)\.
        ServiceRoleArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The service role that the AWS OpsWorks CM service backend uses to
            work with your account\. Although the AWS OpsWorks management
            console typically creates the service role for you, if you are using
            the AWS CLI or API commands, run the service\-role\-creation\.yaml
            AWS CloudFormation template, located at
            https://s3\.amazonaws\.com/opsworks\-cm\-us\-east\-1\-prod\-default\-assets/misc/opsworks\-cm\-roles\.yaml\.
            This template creates a CloudFormation stack that includes the
            service role and instance profile that you need\.
        SubnetIds:
          type: array
          description: >-

            must run within a VPC\. The VPC must have "Auto Assign Public IP"
            enabled\.     EC2\-VPC customers: This field is optional\. If you do
            not specify subnet IDs, your EC2 instances are created in a default
            subnet that is selected by Amazon EC2\. If you specify subnet IDs,
            the VPC must have "Auto Assign Public IP" enabled\.    For more
            information about supported Amazon EC2 platforms, see [Supported
            Platforms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-supported-platforms.html)\.
