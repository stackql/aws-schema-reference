        Email:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The email address associated with the AWS account\.   The [regex
            pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for this parameter is a
            string of characters that represents a standard internet email
            address\.
        ParentIds:
          type: array
          description: >-
            The unique identifier \(ID\) of the root or organizational unit
            \(OU\) that you want to create the new account in\. If you don't
            specify this parameter, the `ParentId` defaults to the root ID\.  
            This parameter only accepts a string array with one string value\.  
            The [regex pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for a parent ID
            string requires one of the following:   +  **Root** \- A string that
            begins with "r\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or
            digits\. +  **Organizational unit \(OU\)** \- A string that begins
            with "ou\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits
            \(the ID of the root that the OU is in\)\. This string is followed
            by a second "\-" dash and from 8 to 32 additional lowercase letters
            or digits\.
        RoleName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of an IAM role that AWS Organizations automatically
            preconfigures in the new member account\. This role trusts the
            management account, allowing users in the management account to
            assume the role, as permitted by the management account
            administrator\. The role has administrator permissions in the new
            member account\.   If you don't specify this parameter, the role
            name defaults to `OrganizationAccountAccessRole`\.   For more
            information about how to use this role to access the member account,
            see the following links:   +  [Accessing and Administering the
            Member Accounts in Your
            Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_access.html#orgs_manage_accounts_create-cross-account-role)

            pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate
            this parameter\. The pattern can include uppercase letters,

            characters: =,\.@\-

          description: >-
            A list of tags that you want to attach to the newly created
            account\. For each tag in the list, you must specify both a tag key
            and a value\. You can set the value to an empty string, but you
            can't set it to `null`\. For more information about tagging, see

            resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tagging.html)

            The friendly name of this OU\.   The [regex
            pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) that is used to validate
            this parameter is a string of any of the characters in the ASCII
            character range\.

          description: >-
            The unique identifier \(ID\) of the parent root or OU that you want
            to create the new OU in\.   To update the `ParentId` parameter
            value, you must first remove all accounts attached to the
            organizational unit \(OU\)\. OUs can't be moved within the
            organization with accounts still attached\. The [regex
            pattern](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/regex) for a parent ID string
            requires one of the following:   +  **Root** \- A string that begins
            with "r\-" followed by from 4 to 32 lowercase letters or digits\. + 
            **Organizational unit \(OU\)** \- A string that begins with "ou\-"

            requires one of the following:   +  **Root** \- A string that begins

            The policy text of the organization resource policy\. You can
            specify the resource policy content as a JSON object or a JSON
