          description: >-
            For domain identities, this attribute is used to enable or disable
            DomainKeys Identified Mail \(DKIM\) signing for the domain\.   If
            the value is `true`, then the messages that you send from the domain
            are signed using both the DKIM keys for your domain, as well as the
            keys for the `amazonses.com` domain\. If the value is `false`, then
            the messages that you send are only signed using the DKIM keys for
            the `amazonses.com` domain\.

          description: >-
            Used to enable or disable feedback forwarding for an identity\. This
            setting determines what happens when an identity is used to send an
            email that results in a bounce or complaint event\.   When you
            enable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends you email
            notifications when bounce or complaint events occur\. Amazon
            Pinpoint sends this notification to the address that you specified
            in the Return\-Path header of the original email\.   When you
            disable feedback forwarding, Amazon Pinpoint sends notifications
            through other mechanisms, such as by notifying an Amazon SNS topic\.
            You're required to have a method of tracking bounces and
            complaints\. If you haven't set up another mechanism for receiving
            bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email
            notification when these events occur \(even if this setting is
            disabled\)\.
