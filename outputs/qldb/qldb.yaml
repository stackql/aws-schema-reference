    Ledger:
      type: object
      properties:
        DeletionProtection:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether the ledger is protected from being deleted by any
            user\. If not defined during ledger creation, this feature is
            enabled \(`true`\) by default\.   If deletion protection is enabled,
            you must first disable it before you can delete the ledger\. You can
            disable it by calling the `UpdateLedger` operation to set this
            parameter to `false`\.
        KmsKey:
          description: >-
            The key in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\) to use for
            encryption of data at rest in the ledger\. For more information, see
            [Encryption at
            rest](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/encryption-at-rest.html)
            in the *Amazon QLDB Developer Guide*\.   Use one of the following
            options to specify this parameter:   +  `AWS_OWNED_KMS_KEY`: Use an
            AWS KMS key that is owned and managed by AWS on your behalf\. + 
            **Undefined**: By default, use an AWS owned KMS key\. +  **A valid
            symmetric customer managed KMS key**: Use the specified symmetric
            encryption KMS key in your account that you create, own, and
            manage\.
        undefined:
          type: string
          description: >-
            By default, this mode denies all user requests to run any PartiQL
            commands on any tables in this ledger\. To allow PartiQL commands to
            run, you must create IAM permissions policies for specific table
            resources and PartiQL actions, in addition to the `SendCommand` API
            permission for the ledger\. For information, see [Getting started
            with the standard permissions
            mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-standard-mode.html)
            in the *Amazon QLDB Developer Guide*\. We strongly recommend using
            the `STANDARD` permissions mode to maximize the security of your
            ledger data\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the ledger that you want to create\. The name must be
            unique among all of the ledgers in your AWS account in the current
            Region\.   Naming constraints for ledger names are defined in
            [Quotas in Amazon
            QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/limits.html#limits.naming)
            in the *Amazon QLDB Developer Guide*\.
        PermissionsMode:
          description: >-
            The permissions mode to assign to the ledger that you want to
            create\. This parameter can have one of the following values:   + 
            `ALLOW_ALL`: A legacy permissions mode that enables access control
            with API\-level granularity for ledgers\.

    Stream:
      type: object
      properties:
        ExclusiveEndTime:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The exclusive date and time that specifies when the stream ends\. If
            you don't define this parameter, the stream runs indefinitely until
            you cancel it\.   The `ExclusiveEndTime` must be in `ISO 8601` date
            and time format and in Universal Coordinated Time \(UTC\)\. For
            example: `2019-06-13T21:36:34Z`\.
        InclusiveStartTime:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The inclusive start date and time from which to start streaming
            journal data\. This parameter must be in `ISO 8601` date and time
            format and in Universal Coordinated Time \(UTC\)\. For example:
            `2019-06-13T21:36:34Z`\.   The `InclusiveStartTime` cannot be in the
            future and must be before `ExclusiveEndTime`\.   If you provide an
            `InclusiveStartTime` that is before the ledger's `CreationDateTime`,
            QLDB effectively defaults it to the ledger's `CreationDateTime`\.
        KinesisConfiguration:
          type: >-
            [kinesisconfiguration](aws-properties-qldb-stream-kinesisconfiguration.md)
          description: >-
            The configuration settings of the Kinesis Data Streams destination
            for your stream request\.
        LedgerName:
          type: string
          description: The name of the ledger\.
        RoleArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) of the IAM role that grants QLDB
            permissions for a journal stream to write data records to a Kinesis
            Data Streams resource\.   To pass a role to QLDB when requesting a
            journal stream, you must have permissions to perform the
            `iam:PassRole` action on the IAM role resource\. This is required
            for all journal stream requests\.
        StreamName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name that you want to assign to the QLDB journal stream\.
            User\-defined names can help identify and indicate the purpose of a
            stream\.   Your stream name must be unique among other *active*
            streams for a given ledger\. Stream names have the same naming
            constraints as ledger names, as defined in [Quotas in Amazon
            QLDB](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/qldb/latest/developerguide/limits.html#limits.naming)
            in the *Amazon QLDB Developer Guide*\.
