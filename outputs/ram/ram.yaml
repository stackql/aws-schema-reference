      properties:
        AllowExternalPrincipals:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether principals outside your organization in AWS
            Organizations can be associated with a resource share\. A value of
            `true` lets you share with individual AWS accounts that are *not* in
            your organization\. A value of `false` only has meaning if your
            account is a member of an AWS Organization\. The default value is
            `true`\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: Specifies the name of the resource share\.
        PermissionArns:

            of the AWS RAM permission to associate with the resource share\. If
            you do not specify an ARN for the permission, AWS RAM automatically
            attaches the default version of the permission for each resource
            type\. You can associate only one permission with each resource type
            included in the resource share\.
        Principals:
          type: array
          description: >-

            resource share\.   You can include the following values:   + An AWS
            account ID, for example: `123456789012`  + An [Amazon Resoure Name
            \(ARN\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html)
            of an organization in AWS Organizations, for example:
            `arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:organization/o-exampleorgid`  +
            An ARN of an organizational unit \(OU\) in AWS Organizations, for
            example:
            `arn:aws:organizations::123456789012:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid-exampleouid123` 
            + An ARN of an IAM role, for example:
            `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/rolename`  + An ARN of an IAM user,
            for example: `arn:aws:iam::123456789012user/username`  Not all
            resource types can be shared with IAM roles and users\. For more
            information, see [Sharing with IAM roles and
            users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/permissions.html#permissions-rbp-supported-resource-types)
