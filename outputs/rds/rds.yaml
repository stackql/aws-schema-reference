            VPCSecurityGroups, and vice versa\. Also, note that the
            DBSecurityGroups property exists only for backwards compatibility
            with older regions and is no longer recommended for providing
            security information to an RDS DB instance\. Instead, use

            empty string or the `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` declaration has no
            `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property, AWS CloudFormation creates a new
            database\. If the property contains a value \(other than an empty
            string\), AWS CloudFormation creates a database from the specified
            snapshot\. If a snapshot with the specified name doesn't exist, AWS
            CloudFormation can't create the database and it rolls back the
            stack\.   Some DB instance properties aren't valid when you restore
            from a snapshot, such as the `MasterUsername` and

            properties that you can specify, see the
            `RestoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot` action in the *Amazon RDS API
            Reference*\.   After you restore a DB instance with a
            `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property, you must specify the same
            `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property for any future updates to the DB
            instance\. When you specify this property for an update, the DB
            instance is not restored from the DB snapshot again, and the data in
            the database is not changed\. However, if you don't specify the
            `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property, an empty DB instance is created,
            and the original DB instance is deleted\. If you specify a property
            that is different from the previous snapshot restore property, a new
            DB instance is restored from the specified `DBSnapshotIdentifier`
            property, and the original DB instance is deleted\.   If you specify
            the `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property to restore a DB instance \(as
            opposed to specifying it for DB instance updates\), then don't
            specify the following properties:   + `CharacterSetName` +

            provisions\. The value must be equal to or greater than 1000\.    If
            you specify this property, you must follow the range of allowed
            ratios of your requested IOPS rate to the amount of storage that you
            allocate \(IOPS to allocated storage\)\. For example, you can
            provision an Oracle database instance with 1000 IOPS and 200 GiB of

        KmsKeyId:
          type: string
          description: >-

            If you enable the StorageEncrypted property but don't specify this
            property, AWS CloudFormation uses the default KMS key\. If you
            specify this property, you must set the StorageEncrypted property to
            true\.    If you specify the `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` property,
            the value is inherited from the source DB instance if the read
            replica is created in the same region\.   If you create an encrypted
            read replica in a different AWS Region, then you must specify a KMS
            key for the destination AWS Region\. KMS encryption keys are
            specific to the region that they're created in, and you can't use
            encryption keys from one region in another region\.   If you specify
            the `SnapshotIdentifier` property, the `StorageEncrypted` property
            value is inherited from the snapshot, and if the DB instance is
            encrypted, the specified `KmsKeyId` property is used\.   If you
            specify `DBSecurityGroups`, AWS CloudFormation ignores this
            property\. To specify both a security group and this property, you
            must use a VPC security group\. For more information about Amazon
            RDS and VPC, see [Using Amazon RDS with Amazon

          description: >-
            If you want to create a read replica DB instance, specify the ID of
            the source DB instance\. Each DB instance can have a limited number
            of read replicas\. For more information, see [Working with Read
            Replicas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/DeveloperGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html)

            in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*\.   The `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`
            property determines whether a DB instance is a read replica\. If you
            remove the `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier` property from your template
            and then update your stack, AWS CloudFormation promotes the Read
            Replica to a standalone DB instance\.   + If you specify a source DB
            instance that uses VPC security groups, we recommend that you
            specify the `VPCSecurityGroups` property\. If you don't specify the
            property, the read replica inherits the value of the
            `VPCSecurityGroups` property from the source DB when you create the
            replica\. However, if you update the stack, AWS CloudFormation
            reverts the replica's `VPCSecurityGroups` property to the default
            value because it's not defined in the stack's template\. This change
            might cause unexpected issues\. + Read replicas don't support
            deletion policies\. AWS CloudFormation ignores any deletion policy
            that's associated with a read replica\. + If you specify
            `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`, don't specify the
            `DBSnapshotIdentifier` property\. You can't create a read replica
            from a snapshot\. + Don't set the `BackupRetentionPeriod`, `DBName`,
            `MasterUsername`, `MasterUserPassword`, and `PreferredBackupWindow`
            properties\. The database attributes are inherited from the source
            DB instance, and backups are disabled for read replicas\. + If the
            source DB instance is in a different region than the read replica,
            specify the source region in `SourceRegion`, and specify an ARN for
            a valid DB instance in `SourceDBInstanceIdentifier`\. For more
            information, see [ Constructing a Amazon RDS Amazon Resource Name

            in the *Amazon RDS User Guide*\. + For DB instances in Amazon Aurora
            clusters, don't specify this property\. Amazon RDS automatically
            assigns writer and reader DB instances\.

            and vice versa\.   You can migrate a DB instance in your stack from
            an RDS DB security group to a VPC security group, but keep the
            following in mind:   + You can't revert to using an RDS security
            group after you establish a VPC security group membership\. + When
            you migrate your DB instance to VPC security groups, if your stack

            update fails in another AWS CloudFormation resource, the rollback
            fails because it can't revert to an RDS security group\. + To use
            the properties that are available when you use a VPC security group,
            you must recreate the DB instance\. If you don't, AWS CloudFormation
            submits only the property values that are listed in the
