            Connected home settings to use on a streaming video\. You can use a
            stream processor for connected home features and select what you
            want the stream processor to detect, such as people or pets\. When
            the stream processor has started, one notification is sent for each
            object class specified\. For more information, see the ConnectedHome
            section of

            Amazon Rekognition's Video Stream Processor takes a Kinesis video
            stream as input\. This is the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams instance
            to which the Amazon Rekognition stream processor streams the
            analysis results\. This must be created within the constraints
            specified at

            KMS key\)\. Optional parameter for connected home stream processors
            used to encrypt results and data published to your Amazon S3
            bucket\. For more information, see the KMSKeyId section of
            [CreateStreamProcessor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStreamProcessor)\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The Name attribute specifies the name of the stream processor and it
            must be within the constraints described in the Name section of
            [StreamProcessor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/APIReference/API_StreamProcessor)\.
            If you don't specify a name, Amazon CloudFormation generates a
            unique ID and uses that ID for the stream processor name\.
        NotificationChannel:

            Rekognition publishes the object detection results and completion
            status of a video analysis operation\. Amazon Rekognition publishes
            a notification the first time an object of interest or a person is
            detected in the video stream\. Amazon Rekognition also publishes an
            end\-of\-session notification with a summary when the stream
            processing session is complete\. For more information, see
            [StreamProcessorNotificationChannel](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/APIReference/API_StreamProcessorNotificationChannel)\.

            [Point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/APIReference/API_Point)
            objects\. Each entry of the set contains a polygon denoting a region
            of interest on the screen\. Each polygon is an ordered list of
            [Point](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/APIReference/API_Point)
            objects\. For more information, see the Polygon field of

          type: string
          description: >-
            The ARN of the IAM role that allows access to the stream processor\.
            The IAM role provides Rekognition read permissions to the Kinesis
            stream\. It also provides write permissions to an Amazon S3 bucket
            and Amazon Simple Notification Service topic for a connected home
            stream processor\. This is required for both face search and
            connected home stream processors\. For information about
            constraints, see the RoleArn section of
            [CreateStreamProcessor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/APIReference/API_CreateStreamProcessor)\.
