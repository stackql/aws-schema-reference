            Specifies the type of the index in this Region\. For information
            about the aggregator index and how it differs from a local index,
            see [Turning on cross\-Region search by creating an aggregator
            index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-aggregator-region.html)

          description: >-
            An array of strings that include search keywords, prefixes, and
            operators that filter the results that are returned for queries made
            using this view\. When you use this view in a
            [Search](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/APIReference/API_Search.html)
            operation, the filter string is combined with the search's
            `QueryString` parameter using a logical `AND` operator\.   For
            information about the supported syntax, see [Search query reference
            for Resource
            Explorer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html)
            in the *AWS Resource Explorer User Guide*\.   This query string in
            the context of this operation supports only [filter
            prefixes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-filters)
            with optional
            [operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/using-search-query-syntax.html#query-syntax-operators)\.
            It doesn't support free\-form text\. For example, the string
            `region:us* service:ec2 -tag:stage=prod` includes all Amazon EC2
            resources in any AWS Region that begin with the letters `us` and are
            *not* tagged with a key `Stage` that has the value `prod`\.
