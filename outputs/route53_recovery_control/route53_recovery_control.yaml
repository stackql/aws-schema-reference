          description: >-
            An assertion rule enforces that, when you change a routing control
            state, that the criteria that you set in the rule configuration is
            met\. Otherwise, the change to the routing control is not accepted\.
            For example, the criteria might be that at least one routing control
            state is `On` after the transaction so that traffic continues to
            flow to at least one cell for the application\. This ensures that
            you avoid a fail\-open scenario\.
        ControlPanelArn:
          type: string
          description: The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) for the control panel\.
        GatingRule:
          type: >-
            [gatingrule](aws-properties-route53recoverycontrol-safetyrule-gatingrule.md)
          description: >-
            A gating rule verifies that a gating routing control or set of
            gating routing controls, evaluates as true, based on a rule
            configuration that you specify, which allows a set of routing
            control state changes to complete\.   For example, if you specify
            one gating routing control and you set the `Type` in the rule
            configuration to `OR`, that indicates that you must set the gating
            routing control to `On` for the rule to evaluate as true; that is,
            for the gating control "switch" to be "On"\. When you do that, then
            you can update the routing control states for the target routing
            controls that you specify in the gating rule\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name of the assertion rule\. The name must be unique within a
            control panel\. You can use any non\-white space character in the
            name except the following: & > < ' \(single quote\) " \(double
            quote\) ; \(semicolon\)
        RuleConfig:
          type: >-
            [ruleconfig](aws-properties-route53recoverycontrol-safetyrule-ruleconfig.md)
          description: >-
            The criteria that you set for specific assertion controls \(routing
            controls\) that designate how many control states must be `ON` as
            the result of a transaction\. For example, if you have three
            assertion controls, you might specify `ATLEAST 2` for your rule
            configuration\. This means that at least two assertion controls must
            be `ON`, so that at least two AWS Regions have traffic flowing to
            them\.
