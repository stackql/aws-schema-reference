      properties:
        BucketName:
          type: string
          description: >-
            A name for the S3 on Outposts bucket\. If you don't specify a name,
            AWS CloudFormation generates a unique ID and uses that ID for the
            bucket name\. The bucket name must contain only lowercase letters,
            numbers, periods \(\.\), and dashes \(\-\) and must follow [ Amazon
            S3 bucket restrictions and
            limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/BucketRestrictions.html)\.
            For more information, see [Bucket naming
            rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/BucketRestrictions.html#bucketnamingrules)\.   
            If you specify a name, you can't perform updates that require
            replacement of this resource\. You can perform updates that require
            no or some interruption\. If you need to replace the resource,
            specify a new name\.

          description: >-
            Creates a new lifecycle configuration for the S3 on Outposts bucket
            or replaces an existing lifecycle configuration\. Outposts buckets
            only support lifecycle configurations that delete/expire objects
            after a certain period of time and abort incomplete multipart
            uploads\.

            [tag](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudformation/latest/userguide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html)
          description: >-
            Sets the tags for an S3 on Outposts bucket\. For more information,
            see [Using Amazon S3 on
            Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html)\.  
            Use tags to organize your AWS bill to reflect your own cost
            structure\. To do this, sign up to get your AWS account bill with
            tag key values included\. Then, to see the cost of combined
            resources, organize your billing information according to resources
            with the same tag key values\. For example, you can tag several
            resources with a specific application name, and then organize your
            billing information to see the total cost of that application across
            several services\. For more information, see [Cost allocation and
            tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html)\.  
            Within a bucket, if you add a tag that has the same key as an
            existing tag, the new value overwrites the old value\. For more
            information, see [ Using cost allocation and bucket
            tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/CostAllocTagging.html)\.
            To use this resource, you must have permissions to perform the
            `s3-outposts:PutBucketTagging`\. The S3 on Outposts bucket owner has
            this permission by default and can grant this permission to others\.
            For more information about permissions, see [Permissions Related to
            Bucket Subresource
            Operations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources)
