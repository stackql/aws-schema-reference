    Schedule:
      type: object
      properties:
        Description:
          type: string
          description: The description you specify for the schedule\.
        EndDate:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The date, in UTC, before which the schedule can invoke its target\.
            Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression, invocations might
            stop on, or before, the `EndDate` you specify\. EventBridge
            Scheduler ignores `EndDate` for one\-time schedules\.
        FlexibleTimeWindow:
          type: >-
            [flexibletimewindow](aws-properties-scheduler-schedule-flexibletimewindow.md)
          description: >-
            Allows you to configure a time window during which EventBridge
            Scheduler invokes the schedule\.
        GroupName:
          type: string
          description: The name of the schedule group associated with this schedule\.
        KmsKeyArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\) for the customer managed KMS key
            that EventBridge Scheduler will use to encrypt and decrypt your
            data\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: The name of the schedule\.
        ScheduleExpression:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The expression that defines when the schedule runs\. The following
            formats are supported\.    +  `at` expression \-
            `at(yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss)`  +  `rate` expression \- `rate(unit
            value)`  +  `cron` expression \- `cron(fields)`   You can use `at`
            expressions to create one\-time schedules that invoke a target once,
            at the time and in the time zone, that you specify\. You can use
            `rate` and `cron` expressions to create recurring schedules\.
            Rate\-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target at
            regular intervals, such as every 15 minutes or every five days\.
            Cron\-based schedules are useful when you want to invoke a target
            periodically at a specific time, such as at 8:00 am \(UTC\+0\) every
            1st day of the month\.     A `cron` expression consists of six
            fields separated by white spaces: `(minutes hours day_of_month month
            day_of_week year)`\.     A `rate` expression consists of a *value*
            as a positive integer, and a *unit* with the following options:
            `minute` \| `minutes` \| `hour` \| `hours` \| `day` \| `days`

        ScheduleExpressionTimezone:
          type: string
          description: The timezone in which the scheduling expression is evaluated\.
        StartDate:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The date, in UTC, after which the schedule can begin invoking its
            target\. Depending on the schedule's recurrence expression,
            invocations might occur on, or after, the `StartDate` you specify\.
            EventBridge Scheduler ignores `StartDate` for one\-time schedules\.
        State:
          type: string
          description: Specifies whether the schedule is enabled or disabled\.
        Target:
