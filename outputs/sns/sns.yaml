            operation that only updates the `Region` property of a
            `AWS::SNS::Subscription` resource, that operation will fail unless

            and hyphens, and must be between 1 and 256 characters long\. FIFO
            topic names must end with `.fifo`\.   If you don't specify a name,
            AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID
