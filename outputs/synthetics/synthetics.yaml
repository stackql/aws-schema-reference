    Canary:
      type: object
      properties:
        ArtifactConfig:
          type: '[artifactconfig](aws-properties-synthetics-canary-artifactconfig.md)'
          description: >-
            A structure that contains the configuration for canary artifacts,
            including the encryption\-at\-rest settings for artifacts that the
            canary uploads to Amazon S3\.
        ArtifactS3Location:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the
            runs of this canary\. Artifacts include the log file, screenshots,
            and HAR files\. Specify the full location path, including `s3://` at
            the beginning of the path\.
        Code:
          type: '[code](aws-properties-synthetics-canary-code.md)'
          description: >-
            Use this structure to input your script code for the canary\. This
            structure contains the Lambda handler with the location where the
            canary should start running the script\. If the script is stored in
            an S3 bucket, the bucket name, key, and version are also included\.
            If the script is passed into the canary directly, the script code is
            contained in the value of `Script`\.
        DeleteLambdaResourcesOnCanaryDeletion:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specifies whether AWS CloudFormation is to also delete the Lambda
            functions and layers used by this canary, when the canary is
            deleted\. The default is false\.
        ExecutionRoleArn:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The ARN of the IAM role to be used to run the canary\. This role
            must already exist, and must include `lambda.amazonaws.com` as a
            principal in the trust policy\. The role must also have the
            following permissions:   +  `s3:PutObject`  + 
            `s3:GetBucketLocation`  +  `s3:ListAllMyBuckets`  + 
            `cloudwatch:PutMetricData`  +  `logs:CreateLogGroup`  + 
            `logs:CreateLogStream`  +  `logs:PutLogEvents`
        FailureRetentionPeriod:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The number of days to retain data about failed runs of this canary\.
            If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used\. The valid
            range is 1 to 455 days\.
        Name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            The name for this canary\. Be sure to give it a descriptive name
            that distinguishes it from other canaries in your account\.   Do not
            include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names\.
            The canary name makes up part of the canary ARN, and the ARN is
            included in outbound calls over the internet\. For more information,
            see [Security Considerations for Synthetics
            Canaries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/servicelens_canaries_security.html)\.
        RunConfig:
          type: '[runconfig](aws-properties-synthetics-canary-runconfig.md)'
          description: >-
            A structure that contains input information for a canary run\. If
            you omit this structure, the frequency of the canary is used as
            canary's timeout value, up to a maximum of 900 seconds\.
        RuntimeVersion:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Specifies the runtime version to use for the canary\. For more
            information about runtime versions, see [ Canary Runtime
            Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_Library.html)\.
        Schedule:
          type: '[schedule](aws-properties-synthetics-canary-schedule.md)'
          description: >-
            A structure that contains information about how often the canary is
            to run, and when these runs are to stop\.
        StartCanaryAfterCreation:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Specify TRUE to have the canary start making runs immediately after
            it is created\.   A canary that you create using CloudFormation
            can't be used to monitor the CloudFormation stack that creates the
            canary or to roll back that stack if there is a failure\.
        SuccessRetentionPeriod:
          type: integer
          description: >-
            The number of days to retain data about successful runs of this
            canary\. If you omit this field, the default of 31 days is used\.
            The valid range is 1 to 455 days\.

        VisualReference:
          type: >-
            [visualreference](aws-properties-synthetics-canary-visualreference.md)
          description: >-
            If this canary performs visual monitoring by comparing screenshots,
            this structure contains the ID of the canary run to use as the
            baseline for screenshots, and the coordinates of any parts of the
            screen to ignore during the visual monitoring comparison\.
        VPCConfig:
          type: '[vpcconfig](aws-properties-synthetics-canary-vpcconfig.md)'
          description: >-
            If this canary is to test an endpoint in a VPC, this structure
            contains information about the subnet and security groups of the VPC
            endpoint\. For more information, see [ Running a Canary in a
            VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch_Synthetics_Canaries_VPC.html)\.
